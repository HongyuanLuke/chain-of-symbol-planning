There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is school D. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school D to store F. There is a road which is 100 meters long from store F to bank C. There is a road which is 200 meters long from store F to cinema I. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school D to school B. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school B to bank J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank J to bank H. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest cinema?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at school D.
2. There is only one cinema on the map, cinema I.
3. The road from school D to cinema I is from school D to store F to cinema I (100 meters + 200 meters = 300 meters)
4. There are no other cinemas on the map, so cinema I is the nearest cinema from the start point (school D).
5. Therefore, the nearest cinema from the start point (school D) is cinema I.
So the answer is DFI.

There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is cinema J. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema J to garden B. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema J to cinema E. There is a road which is 100 meters long from cinema E to house I. There is a road which is 200 meters long from house I to bank C. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank C to school F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from school F to house A. ", "Question": "From the start point, how to reach the nearest bank?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at cinema J.
2. There is one bank on the map, bank C.

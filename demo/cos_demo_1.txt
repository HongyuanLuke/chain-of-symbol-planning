Question:
There are a set of bricks. For the brick B, the color is yellow. The yellow brick C is on top of the brick B . The yellow brick A is on top of the brick C . Now we have to get a specific brick. The bricks must now be grabbed from top to bottom, and if the lower brick is to be grabbed, the upper brick must be removed first. How to get brick B
Using the symbolic method to convert text to symbols,  B//A means A is on top of B. Then combine the relation together, then solve this question recursively and keep the last sentence as the format of 'so we get the result as (the sequence of names of bricks in order):
Answer: 
B//C//A, so we get the result as A, C, B.

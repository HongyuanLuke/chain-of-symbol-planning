There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is bank A. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank A to bank C. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank C to house H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house H to cinema F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema F to store B. There is a road which is 100 meters long from store B to store G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank C to house D. There is a road which is 200 meters long from house D to garden J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank A to cinema I. There is a road which is 100 meters long from cinema I to house E. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest store?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at bank A.
2. There are two stores on the map, store B and store G.
3. The road from bank A to store B is from bank A to bank C to house H to cinema F to store B (200 meters + 100 meters + 100 meters + 200 meters = 600 meters)
4. The road from bank A to store B is shorter than the road from bank A to store G.
5. Therefore, the nearest store from the start point (bank A) is store B.
So the answer is ACHFB.

There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is bank H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank H to store E. There is a road which is 200 meters long from store E to bank C. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank C to house A. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house A to house F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank C to garden I. There is a road which is 200 meters long from store E to cinema G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema G to school J. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank H to school D. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school D to store B. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest school?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at bank H.
2. There are two schools on the map, school J and school D.
3. The road from bank H to school J is from bank H to store E to cinema G to school J (200 meters + 200 meters + 200 meters = 600 meters).
4. The road from bank H to school D is from bank H to school D (200 meters).
5. Therefore, the nearest school from the start point (bank H) is school D.
6. Follow the road from bank H to school D (200 meters).
So the answer is HD

There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is garden B. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden B to cinema D. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema D to school J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from garden B to school I. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school I to house C. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house C to bank F. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house C to cinema G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema G to store H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from store H to cinema E. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema E to bank A. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest school?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at garden B.
2. There are two schools on the map, school J and school I.
3. The road from garden B to school J is from garden B to cinema D to school J (200 meters + 200 meters = 400 meters).
4. The road from garden B to school I is from garden B to school I (100 meters).
5. Therefore, the nearest school from the start point (garden B) is school I.
6. Follow the road from garden B to school I (100 meters).
So the answer is BI

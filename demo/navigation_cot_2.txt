There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is garden J. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden J to bank I. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank I to school B. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden J to house F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from house F to school E. There is a road which is 200 meters long from school E to bank A. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank A to bank H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house F to school G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from school G to bank C.
From the start point, how to reach the nearest school?
There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is garden J. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden J to bank I. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank I to school B. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden J to house F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from house F to school E. There is a road which is 200 meters long from school E to bank A. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank A to bank H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house F to school G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from school G to bank C.
From the start point, how to reach the nearest school?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at garden J.
2. There are three schools on the map, school B, school E, and school G.
3. The road from garden J to school B is from garden J to bank I to school B (200 meters + 200 meters = 400 meters)
4. The road from garden J to school E is from garden J to house F to school E (200 meters+ 200 meters = 400 meters)
5. The road from garden J to school G is from garden J to house F to school G (200 meters + 100 meters = 300 meters)
6. The road to school G is shorter than the roads to school B and school E.
7. Therefore, the nearest school from the start point (garden J) is school G.
So the answer is JFG.

There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is bank H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank H to garden G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden G to garden J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from garden J to bank C. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank C to store A. There is a road which is 200 meters long from garden G to cinema I. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema I to house D. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest cinema?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at bank H.
2. There is only one cinema on the map, cinema I.
3. The road from bank H to cinema I is from bank H to garden G to cinema I (100 meters + 200 meters = 300 meters)
4. The road from bank H to cinema I is shorter than the road from bank H to cinema F.
5. Therefore, the nearest cinema from the start point (bank H) is cinema I.
So the answer is HGI.

There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is school D. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school D to store F. There is a road which is 100 meters long from store F to bank C. There is a road which is 200 meters long from store F to cinema I. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school D to school B. There is a road which is 100 meters long from school B to bank J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank J to bank H. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest cinema?
Let's think step by step
1. Start at school D.
2. There is only one cinema on the map, cinema I.
3. The road from school D to cinema I is from school D to store F to cinema I (100 meters + 200 meters = 300 meters)
4. Therefore, the nearest cinema from the start point (school D) is cinema I.
So the answer is DFI.

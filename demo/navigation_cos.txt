There is a set of roads and a set of landmarks. The start point is bank A. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank A to bank C. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank C to house H. There is a road which is 100 meters long from house H to cinema F. There is a road which is 200 meters long from cinema F to store B. There is a road which is 100 meters long from store B to store G. There is a road which is 200 meters long from bank C to house D. There is a road which is 200 meters long from house D to garden J. There is a road which is 100 meters long from bank A to cinema I. There is a road which is 100 meters long from cinema I to house E. 
From the start point, how to reach the nearest store?
- bank A -> bank C: 200m
- bank C -> house H: 100m
- house H -> cinema F: 100m
- cinema F -> store B: 200m
- store B -> store G: 100m
- bank C -> house D: 200m
- house D -> garden J: 200m
- bank A -> cinema I: 100m
- cinema I -> house E: 100m
There are two stores on the map, store B and store G.
- bank A -> bank C -> house H -> cinema F -> store B (200 + 100 + 100 + 200 = 600)
- bank A -> bank C -> house H -> cinema F -> store B -> store G (200 + 100 + 100 + 200 + 100 = 700)
So we get the result as bank A -> bank C -> house H -> cinema F -> store B.
So the answer is ACHFB
